This repository contains a custom, continuously updated version of libft that I maintain for use in my personal and academic projects.

While it is originally based on the 42 libft, it has evolved beyond the constraints of the original assignment and may include:

Additional functions

Modified implementations

Utility features not allowed in the official version

If you're looking for my submission-compliant libft, please refer to the separate repository intended specifically for the 42 project.
